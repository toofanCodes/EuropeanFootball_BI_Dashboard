- **Dataset/**: Contains raw or processed data files that feed into the dashboard.
- **SQL Files/**: Holds SQL scripts used for querying, cleaning, and preparing the data.
- **Europe_Football_Dashboard.pbix**: The main Power BI file that hosts the dashboard, ready to be opened in Power BI Desktop.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Power BI Desktop**: Download from [Power BI official website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
- (Optional) SQL Server or another database system if you plan to run the SQL scripts locally.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toofanCodes/EuropeanFootball_BI_Dashboard.git
   cd EuropeanFootball_BI_Dashboard
   ```

2. **Open the Power BI file:**

   - Launch Power BI Desktop.
   - Open the `Europe_Football_Dashboard.pbix` file from the repository.

## Data and SQL Scripts

- **Dataset Folder:**  
  This folder contains the necessary data files. These may include CSVs, Excel files, or other formats that the dashboard uses.
  
- **SQL Files Folder:**  
  This folder includes SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Review and run these scripts to update or prepare the data before refreshing the dashboard.

## Usage

Once you open the Power BI file in Power BI Desktop:

1. **Refresh Data:**  
   Use the “Refresh” button to update the dashboard with the latest data from the Dataset folder and SQL outputs.
   
2. **Interact with Visuals:**  
   Utilize interactive charts, filters, and slicers to dive into the specifics of European football statistics.
   
3. **Modify SQL Scripts:**  
   If you need to update data or adjust transformations, modify the SQL files and refresh your data accordingly.
